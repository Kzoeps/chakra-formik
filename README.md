# Chakra Formik

A package to bind chakra forms with formik. Removes having to build a reusable `AppInput` component.

# Reason for building

I know there's already a package for this but this is my experimental playground to learn
1. testing
2. making a reusable package
3. publishing it

this is also heavily inspired (*cough (copy-pasting)*) by [formik-antd](https://github.com/jannikbuschke/formik-antd).

# TODOs
- [x] simple input field
- [x] errors and validation for simple input field
- [x] select field
- [ ] checkbox
- [ ] RadioGroup
