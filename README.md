# Chakra Formik

A package to bind chakra forms with formik. Removes having to build a reusable `AppInput` component everytime I begin a new project.

# Reason for building

I know there's already a package for this but this is my playground to learn while building something useful for myself

1. testing
2. making a reusable package
3. publishing it

# Documentation

[Docs](https://chakra-formik-docs.vercel.app/)
CodeSandBox: coming soon or maybe never

# TODOs

- [x] simple input field
- [x] errors and validation for simple input field
- [x] select field
- [x] checkbox group
- [x] RadioGroup
